# ðŸ“Š Business Statistics Project â€“ Healthcare & Customer Satisfaction Analytics

This project applies **statistical modeling, data visualization, and predictive analysis** to two real-world datasets in the healthcare and customer satisfaction domains. Using **R and RMarkdown**, we performed hypothesis testing, built classification models, and presented insights through interactive reports.

## Project Overview

This project aimed to:
- Analyze cardiovascular health and customer satisfaction data.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and anomalies.  
- Test hypotheses to assess relationships between key variables.  
- Build **predictive models** for cardiovascular risk and customer churn probability.  
- Present results in an **interactive HTML report** for decision-making.

## Datasets Used

### Cardio_Vascular_Disease.csv
- **Records**: 70,000+ patient entries  
- **Features**:
  - `age`, `gender`, `cholesterol`, `smoke`, `alco`, `active`, `gluc`, `bp_sys`, `bp_dia`, `cardio` (target variable)  
- **Objective**: Predict whether a patient has cardiovascular disease based on health indicators.

### cust_satisfaction.csv
- **Records**: 1,000+ customer survey responses  
- **Features**:
  - `customer_id`, `age_group`, `gender`, `satisfaction_score`, `service_quality`, `responsiveness`, `recommendation`  
- **Objective**: Understand drivers of customer satisfaction and predict likelihood to recommend the service.

## Key Analysis & Insights

### Cardiovascular Dataset
- Performed **hypothesis testing** (chi-square, t-tests) to explore relationships between lifestyle factors and cardiovascular risk.  
- Built a **logistic regression model**:  
  - **Accuracy**: 88%  
  - **Key Predictors**: `age`, `cholesterol`, `smoking`, and `physical activity`.  
- Identified high-risk segments (e.g., older males with high cholesterol and sedentary lifestyle).  

---

### Customer Satisfaction Dataset
- Conducted EDA to visualize satisfaction distribution across demographics.  
- Ran **ANOVA tests** to assess how satisfaction varies by `age_group` and `service_quality`.  
- Developed a classification model:  
  - **Accuracy**: 82%  
  - **Key Drivers**: Service responsiveness and perceived quality strongly impact recommendation likelihood.

|------------------------------|------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cardiovascular               | Logistic Regression    | 88%      | Identified top predictors of cardiovascular disease risk.   |
| Customer Satisfaction        | Logistic Classification| 82%      | Highlighted key factors driving customer recommendations.   |

- Created **interactive charts** (ggplot2) for stakeholder presentations.  
- Delivered a rendered HTML report summarizing actionable recommendations.
